# unicode-algorithms

Based on the provided specification, there is currently minimal unicode-algorithms implementation as the project is in initial stages. However, the planned core components include:

### Key Unicode Processing Components

1. **Pythonic Wrapper Around PyICU**
- Integration with ICU's Unicode processing capabilities
- Focus on natural Python Unicode handling patterns
- Custom logic to bridge PyICU and Python's native Unicode support

2. **fontTools.unicodedata Integration** 
- Supplementary Unicode data support
- Writing system information handling
- Custom data transformation between fontTools and PyICU

The project structure indicates this will be implemented in:
```
src/uicu/
  __init__.py
  uicu.py
```

Current Status:
- Initial project structure created
- Main objective defined to wrap PyICU functionality
- Research phase for fontTools.unicodedata and PyICU APIs
- Implementation not yet started

Core algorithms and Unicode processing logic will be implemented after the research phase is complete, focusing on:
- Character handling
- Unicode normalization
- Locale-specific processing
- Writing system detection and handling
