# unicode-wrapper-models

## Core Data Models

The project defines core data models for wrapping PyICU functionality and integrating with Python's native Unicode handling capabilities. These are designed to expose rich Unicode operations while maintaining a natural Python interface.

### Model Structure
The unicode-wrapper-models aspect focuses on creating Pythonic wrappers around PyICU functionality, supplemented by fontTools.unicodedata. The primary goal is to provide well-documented objects that seamlessly integrate with Python's native Unicode handling while adding extensive Unicode functionality.

### Integration Points
- Interfaces with PyICU for core Unicode operations
- Supplements functionality with fontTools.unicodedata for writing system information
- Provides integration with Python's built-in Unicode handling

### Key Components
While specific model implementations are not yet defined in the specification, the architecture indicates:

1. Wrapper Classes
- Models to encapsulate PyICU functionality
- Integration with Python's native Unicode support
- Rich object interfaces for Unicode operations

2. Unicode Data Models
- Classes for handling Unicode data and properties
- Integration with fontTools.unicodedata
- Support for writing system information

3. Interface Design
- Natural, Pythonic API design
- Well-documented object interfaces
- Performance-focused implementation

The models will be implemented incrementally with a focus on minimal viable functionality, following the project's development guidelines for gradual iteration and code quality standards.
