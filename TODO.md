# Pedalboard Pluginary - Essential Improvements TODO

## Immediate Priority: Integration & Stability

### Scanner Integration
- [x] Integrate parallel scanner as primary scanning backend
- [x] Add CLI option to choose between standard and parallel scanner  
- [x] Migrate existing scanner functionality to use parallel architecture
- [x] Add configuration for worker process count
- [ ] Implement retry mechanism for failed plugins

### Progress Display Enhancement  
- [x] Beautiful Rich progress display for scanning
- [x] Vendor/manufacturer extraction for all plugin types
- [x] Add summary statistics (via info command)
- [ ] Implement verbose and quiet modes
- [ ] Add estimated time remaining display

## Phase 1: Code Organization & Cleanup (Priority: High)

### Module Consolidation
- [ ] Consolidate scanner classes into fewer, more focused modules
- [ ] Merge utility functions scattered across multiple files
- [ ] Reduce import complexity and circular dependencies
- [ ] Simplify protocol definitions where appropriate

### Remove Deprecated Code
- [ ] Remove unused imports and dead code paths
- [ ] Clean up legacy Fire-based CLI remnants  
- [ ] Remove experimental features that aren't production-ready
- [ ] Eliminate redundant type definitions

### Optimize Imports
- [ ] Use `from __future__ import annotations` consistently
- [ ] Minimize runtime imports using TYPE_CHECKING blocks
- [ ] Group and organize imports systematically
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies

## Phase 2: Performance Optimizations (Priority: High)

### SQLite Cache Optimizations
- [ ] Optimize database schema and indexes
- [ ] Add connection pooling for concurrent access
- [ ] Implement prepared statements for frequent queries
- [ ] Add SQLite pragmas for performance tuning
- [ ] Implement cache warming strategies

### Async Processing Improvements
- [ ] Fine-tune concurrency limits based on system resources
- [ ] Implement adaptive concurrency based on system load
- [ ] Add memory-efficient streaming for large plugin sets
- [ ] Optimize task scheduling and batching

### Memory Management
- [ ] Implement lazy loading patterns throughout
- [ ] Add memory profiling and optimization
- [ ] Use __slots__ for frequently instantiated classes
- [ ] Optimize data structures for memory efficiency

## Phase 3: CLI & User Experience (Priority: Medium)

### Modern CLI Framework Migration
- [ ] Migrate from Fire to Click for better structure
- [ ] Add Rich for beautiful terminal output
- [ ] Implement comprehensive help system
- [ ] Add command validation and error handling
- [ ] Create intuitive command structure

### Search & Filtering Enhancement
- [ ] Implement fuzzy search capabilities
- [ ] Add advanced filtering options
- [ ] Create search result ranking system
- [ ] Add export/import functionality
- [ ] Implement plugin recommendation system

## Phase 4: Developer Experience (Priority: Medium)

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Add comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Implement performance regression tests
- [ ] Add async testing utilities
- [ ] Create test fixtures for various plugin types
- [ ] Add property-based testing

### Documentation & Tooling
- [ ] Streamline build system (build.sh optimization)
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect current architecture
- [ ] Add development setup automation
- [ ] Create contributor guidelines
- [ ] Add automated code quality checks

### Configuration Management
- [ ] Add configuration file support
- [ ] Implement environment variable configuration
- [ ] Add configuration validation
- [ ] Create configuration migration utilities
- [ ] Add per-project configuration support

## Phase 5: Production Readiness (Priority: Low)

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add structured logging throughout
- [ ] Implement performance metrics collection
- [ ] Add health check endpoints/commands
- [ ] Create diagnostic utilities
- [ ] Add cache health monitoring

### Error Recovery & Resilience
- [ ] Enhance error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Add circuit breaker patterns for plugin loading
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation
- [ ] Add cache repair utilities
- [ ] Create backup and restore functionality

## Quick Wins (Week 1)
- [ ] Code Cleanup: Remove dead code, optimize imports
- [ ] SQLite Tuning: Add performance pragmas and optimize queries
- [ ] Memory Optimization: Add __slots__ to key classes
- [ ] Documentation: Update README and inline docs
