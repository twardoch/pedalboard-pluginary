- [ ] Implement incremental scan functionality
- [ ] Add modification time tracking
- [ ] Create smart update logic for changed/added/removed plugins

## Phase 2: Modern CLI Revolution (Week 3)

### Migrate to Click + Rich
- [ ] Replace Fire with Click for command structure
- [ ] Add Rich for tables, progress bars, and formatting
- [ ] Implement comprehensive help system
- [ ] Add plugin search and filtering commands
- [ ] Create cache management subcommands

### Advanced Search and Filtering
- [ ] Create PluginSearchEngine with multiple filter options
- [ ] Implement fuzzy search using similarity matching

- [ ] Add sorting and pagination support

## Phase 3: Production Hardening (Week 4)

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration test suite
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks and regression tests
- [ ] Test error scenarios and edge cases

- [ ] Implement continuous integration with multiple Python versions

### Error Recovery and Resilience
- [ ] Create ResilienceManager for error recovery
- [ ] Implement plugin blacklisting for problematic plugins
- [ ] Add safe cache operation wrappers
- [ ] Create cache repair and validation functionality
- [ ] Add health monitoring and status reporting

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)

### Configuration Management System
- [ ] Create Pydantic-based settings with environment variable support
- [ ] Add configuration file support (.env, config files)
- [ ] Implement configuration validation and defaults
- [ ] Create CLI commands for configuration management

### Plugin Categorization System
- [ ] Create PluginCategory enum and categorization rules
- [ ] Implement intelligent categorization based on names and parameters
- [ ] Add category-based filtering and search
- [ ] Create category statistics and reporting

### Export and Integration Features
- [ ] Implement CSV export functionality
- [ ] Add JSON export with comprehensive metadata
- [ ] Create plugin preset system
- [ ] Add bulk import/export capabilities
- [ ] Create DAW integration helpers

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Async scanning 5x faster than sync
- [ ] SQLite cache working for 1000+ plugins
- [ ] Memory usage < 50MB baseline
- [ ] Zero mypy errors maintained

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] New CLI fully replaces Fire-based interface
- [ ] Rich output formatting working
- [ ] All commands have comprehensive help
- [ ] Search and filtering functional

### Phase 3 Completion Criteria
- [ ] >90% test coverage achieved
- [ ] CI passing on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks in place
- [ ] Error recovery working reliably

### Phase 4 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Plugin categorization working accurately

- [ ] Search capabilities fully implemented
- [ ] Configuration system operational

## Dependencies to Add

### Core Dependencies
- [ ] click>=8.0.0 (CLI framework)
- [ ] rich>=13.0.0 (output formatting)
- [ ] pydantic>=2.0.0 (configuration management)

### Development Dependencies
- [ ] pytest-benchmark (performance testing)
- [ ] pytest-asyncio (async testing)
- [ ] psutil (memory testing)

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- [ ] 10-20 plugins/second scan speed (vs 1-2 current)
- [ ] O(log n) search performance (vs O(n) current)
- [ ] Constant memory usage with lazy loading

### Reliability Targets
- [ ] Graceful error handling and recovery
- [ ] 99%+ plugin compatibility
- [ ] Zero data loss on crashes

### Usability Targets
- [ ] Intuitive CLI with comprehensive help
- [ ] Rich formatting and progress reporting
- [ ] Fast search and filtering capabilities

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed (Phase 0)
- Type-safe architecture with comprehensive TypedDict and protocols
- Modular scanner design with extensible BaseScanner
- Robust error handling with custom exception hierarchy
- Unified serialization layer with validation
- Zero mypy errors in strict mode
- Timeout protection for plugin loading

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Planning and design for async implementation
- Architecture review for performance improvements

### ðŸ“‹ Next Priority
1. Implement async scanner architecture (highest impact)
2. Create SQLite cache backend (scalability)
3. Migrate to Click CLI framework (user experience)
