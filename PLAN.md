# Pedalboard Pluginary - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for improving Pedalboard Pluginary, a Python package that scans and catalogs VST-3 and AU audio plugins.

## Project Goals
1. Improve type safety and code quality
2. Add async support for better performance
3. Implement progress callbacks for long-running operations
4. Add caching mechanism for scan results
5. Enhance error handling and resilience
6. Update documentation and build tooling

## Current State Analysis
- The project has a solid foundation with scanner classes for VST3 and AU plugins
- Uses Pedalboard library for plugin loading
- Has basic CLI interface using Fire
- Includes test coverage with pytest
- Has models.py with typed data structures (PluginInfo, PluginParameter)
- Has duplicate code and inconsistencies in scanner.py

## Planned Improvements

### Phase 1: Code Cleanup and Consistency
- [ ] Fix duplicate imports and class definitions in scanner.py
- [ ] Remove redundant scanner methods (scan_aufx_plugins, scan_vst3_plugins)
- [ ] Ensure consistent use of typed models throughout
- [ ] Fix mypy type checking issues

### Phase 2: Enhanced Type Safety
- [ ] Add proper type annotations for all functions
- [ ] Create Protocol definitions for plugin interfaces
- [ ] Add runtime type validation for external data
- [ ] Ensure all pedalboard imports have proper type ignores

### Phase 3: Async Support
- [ ] Convert scanner classes to support async operations
- [ ] Add asyncio-based concurrent plugin scanning
- [ ] Implement async file I/O for cache operations
- [ ] Add CLI support for async operations

### Phase 4: Progress and Callbacks
- [ ] Add progress callback interface to scanners
- [ ] Implement tqdm progress bars for CLI
- [ ] Add programmatic progress callbacks for library usage
- [ ] Support cancellation of long-running scans

### Phase 5: Caching Improvements
- [ ] Implement proper cache invalidation strategy
- [ ] Add cache versioning for compatibility
- [ ] Support partial cache updates
- [ ] Add cache statistics and management commands

### Phase 6: Error Handling
- [ ] Create custom exception hierarchy
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Improve error messages and logging
- [ ] Add plugin validation before caching

### Phase 7: Documentation and Tooling
- [ ] Update README with new features
- [ ] Add API documentation with examples
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Set up proper code coverage reporting
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for code quality

## Technical Decisions
1. Keep Python 3.9 as minimum version for wider compatibility
2. Use asyncio for async support (not trio or other alternatives)
3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
4. Use pydantic for enhanced data validation (optional dependency)
5. Keep Fire for CLI but add proper argument parsing

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass with 90%+ coverage
- Type checking passes with strict mypy settings
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Performance improves for large plugin libraries
- Error handling is robust and informative
