# Pedalboard Pluginary - Essential Improvements Plan

## Overview

Pedalboard Pluginary now features both beautiful progress displays and a stable parallel scanning architecture. This plan focuses on integrating these improvements and implementing essential enhancements for production readiness.

## Recent Achievements (August 2025)

### âœ… Beautiful Rich Progress Display
- Minimalist Rich table showing plugin name, vendor, and progress
- Real-time updates during scanning
- Vendor extraction from both AU and VST3 plugins

### âœ… Stable Parallel Scanner
- Process isolation for crash protection
- Parallel processing with configurable workers
- Timeout protection and failed plugin tracking
- Beautiful Rich progress bar with statistics

### âœ… Complete Process Isolation Scanner
- Created scan_single.py standalone CLI tool that loads one plugin and returns JSON
- Each plugin scanned in completely separate process - crashes don't affect scanner
- IsolatedPedalboardScanner orchestrates subprocess calls safely
- New scanner modules: scanner_isolated.py, scanner_parallel.py, scanner_worker.py
- Created modular scanner architecture with BaseScanner class

## Current State Analysis

### âœ… Completed Major Features
- **Async Architecture**: Full async scanner implementation with concurrency control
- **SQLite Cache Backend**: High-performance SQLite cache with FTS and indexing  
- **Type Safety**: Zero mypy errors across entire codebase
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation with protocols and base classes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy and timeout protection
- **Progress Reporting**: Multiple reporter implementations with rich feedback

### ðŸŽ¯ Areas for Streamlining

## Phase 1: Code Organization & Cleanup (Priority: High)

### 1.1 Module Consolidation
**Current Issue**: Some functionality is spread across too many small modules

**Actions**:
- Consolidate scanner classes into fewer, more focused modules

- Simplify protocol definitions where appropriate

### 1.2 Remove Deprecated Code
**Actions**:
- Remove unused imports and dead code paths
- Clean up legacy Fire-based CLI remnants
- Remove experimental features that aren't production-ready
- Eliminate redundant type definitions

### 1.3 Optimize Imports
**Actions**:
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` consistently
- Minimize runtime imports using TYPE_CHECKING blocks
- Group and organize imports systematically
- Remove unused dependencies

## Phase 2: Performance Optimizations (Priority: High)

### 2.1 SQLite Cache Optimizations
**Current**: SQLite backend is implemented but may need tuning

**Actions**:
- Optimize database schema and indexes

- Optimize task scheduling and batching

### 2.3 Memory Management
**Actions**:
- Implement lazy loading patterns throughout
- Add memory profiling and optimization
- Use __slots__ for frequently instantiated classes
- Optimize data structures for memory efficiency

## Phase 3: CLI & User Experience (Priority: Medium)

### 3.1 Modern CLI Framework Migration
**Current**: Using Fire framework, need modern alternative

**Actions**:
- Migrate from Fire to Click for better structure
- Add Rich for beautiful terminal output
- Implement comprehensive help system
- Add command validation and error handling
- Create intuitive command structure

### 3.2 Search & Filtering Enhancement
**Actions**:
- Implement fuzzy search capabilities
- Add advanced filtering options

## Phase 4: Developer Experience (Priority: Medium)

### 4.1 Testing Infrastructure
**Actions**:
- Add comprehensive integration tests
- Implement performance regression tests
- Add async testing utilities
- Create test fixtures for various plugin types
- Add property-based testing

### 4.2 Documentation & Tooling
**Actions**:
- Streamline build system (build.sh optimization)
- Update documentation to reflect current architecture
- Add development setup automation
- Create contributor guidelines
- Add automated code quality checks

### 4.3 Configuration Management
**Actions**:
- Add configuration file support
- Implement environment variable configuration
- Add configuration validation
- Create configuration migration utilities
- Add per-project configuration support

## Phase 5: Production Readiness (Priority: Low)

### 5.1 Monitoring & Observability
**Actions**:
- Add structured logging throughout
- Implement performance metrics collection
- Add health check endpoints/commands
- Create diagnostic utilities
- Add cache health monitoring

### 5.2 Error Recovery & Resilience
**Actions**:
- Enhance error recovery mechanisms
- Add circuit breaker patterns for plugin loading
- Implement graceful degradation
- Add cache repair utilities
- Create backup and restore functionality

## Implementation Strategy

### Quick Wins (Week 1)
1. **Code Cleanup**: Remove dead code, optimize imports
2. **SQLite Tuning**: Add performance pragmas and optimize queries
3. **Memory Optimization**: Add __slots__ to key classes
4. **Documentation**: Update README and inline docs

### Medium Impact (Week 2-3)
1. **CLI Migration**: Move to Click + Rich framework
2. **Search Enhancement**: Add fuzzy search and advanced filtering
3. **Testing**: Add integration and performance tests
4. **Configuration**: Add config file support

### Long-term Improvements (Week 4+)
1. **Advanced Features**: Plugin recommendations, categorization
2. **Monitoring**: Add observability and health checks
3. **Integration**: DAW integration helpers
4. **Platform Support**: Windows/Linux optimization

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Scan Speed**: Maintain 10-20 plugins/second with async
- **Memory Usage**: Keep baseline under 50MB for large datasets
- **Search Performance**: Sub-100ms for most queries
- **Startup Time**: Under 2 seconds for CLI commands

### Quality Targets  
- **Type Safety**: Maintain zero mypy errors
- **Test Coverage**: Achieve >90% code coverage
- **Documentation**: All public APIs documented
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure for all error conditions

### User Experience Targets
