## JSON output

`python -m pedalboard_pluginary json` gives this structure: 
```
[{"id": "vst3/ABLM2", "name": "ABLM2", "path": "/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/ABLM2.vst3", "type": "vst3", "manufacturer": null, ...
```

I want a dict, where the keys are the `id` fields and the values are dicts with the remaining params.
